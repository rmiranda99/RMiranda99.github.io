## Welcome!

![](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~rmiranda/rmm.jpeg)

I am an Associate Professor at the [University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br/).

My research area is the qualitative theory of dynamical systems: Filippov systems, structural stability, systems with symmetries (Hamiltonian and/or reversible-equivariant), existence and stability of limit cycles, Ricci flow on homogeneous manifolds, etc.
